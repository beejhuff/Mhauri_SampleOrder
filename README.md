Mhauri_SampleOrder
==================

This is my first free Magento extension and provides a solution to order a free sample of any product in the catalog, configured via custom attribute.

It doesnâ€™t provide frontend adaptions. To make it work just add a link like */sampleorder/add/product/id/{product_id}* in your template file.
